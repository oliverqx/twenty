## Overview
Webhooks in Twenty complement the API by enabling **real-time notifications** to your own applications when certain events happen in your CRM. Instead of continuously polling the API for changes, you can set up webhooks to have Twenty **push** data to your system whenever specific events occur (for example, when a new record is created or an existing record is updated). This helps keep external systems in sync with Twenty instantly and efficiently.

With webhooks, Twenty will send an HTTP POST request to a URL you specify, containing details about the event. You can then handle that data in your application (e.g., to update your external database, trigger workflows, or send alerts).

## Setting Up a Webhook
To create a webhook in Twenty, use the **API & Webhooks** settings in your Twenty app (Developer settings):

1. **Navigate to Settings:** In your Twenty application, go to **Settings** (ensure Advanced mode is enabled to see developer options).
2. **Create a Webhook:** Under **Webhooks** click on **+ Create webhook**.
3. **Enter URL:** Provide the endpoint URL on your server where you want Twenty to send webhook requests. This should be a publicly accessible URL that can handle POST requests.
4. **Save:** Click **Save** to create the webhook. The new webhook will be active immediately.

You can create multiple webhooks if you need to send different events to different endpoints. Each webhook is essentially a subscription for all relevant events (at this time, Twenty sends all event types to the given URL; filtering specific event types may be configurable in the UI). If you ever need to remove a webhook, you can delete it from the same settings page (select the webhook and choose delete).

## Events and Payloads
Once a webhook is set up, Twenty will send an HTTP POST request to your specified URL whenever a trigger event occurs in your CRM data. Common events that trigger webhooks include:

* **Record Created:** e.g. a new person is added (`person.created`), a new company is created (`company.created`), a note is created (`note.created`), etc.
* **Record Updated:** e.g. an existing person’s information is updated (`person.updated`), a company record is edited (`company.updated`), etc.
* **Record Deleted:** e.g. a person or company is deleted (`person.deleted`, `company.deleted`).
* **Other Events:** If applicable, other object events or custom triggers (for instance, if tasks or other objects are updated, similar event types would be used like `task.created`, `note.updated`, etc.).

The webhook POST request contains a JSON payload in its body. The payload will generally include at least two things: the type of event, and the data related to that event (often the record that was created/updated). For example, a webhook for a newly created person might send a payload like:

```
{
  "event": "person.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "abc12345",
    "firstName": "Alice",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "createdAt": "2025-02-10T15:30:45Z",
    "createdBy": "user_123"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-02-10T15:30:50Z"
}
```

In this example:
 
* `"event"` specifies what happened (`person.created`).
* `"data"` contains the new record’s details (the same information you would get if you requested that person via the API).
* `"timestamp"` is when the event occurred (in UTC).

Your endpoint should be prepared to receive such JSON data via POST. Typically, you’ll parse the JSON, look at the `"event"` type to understand what happened, and then use the `"data"` accordingly (e.g., create a new contact in your system, or update an existing one).
 
**Note:** It’s important to respond with a **2xx HTTP status** from your webhook endpoint to acknowledge successful receipt. If the Twenty webhook sender does not get a 2xx response, it may consider the delivery failed. (In the future, retry logic might attempt to resend failed webhooks, so always strive to return a 200 OK as quickly as possible after processing the data.)

## Security and Best Practices
When using webhooks, you should secure your endpoint since it will be accepting incoming requests:

* **Validate Source:** Since the requests come from Twenty’s servers, you may want to verify the request truly originated from Twenty. Currently, Twenty’s webhook requests do not include a built-in signature or secret (no shared secret token was set during creation in the current version). A common practice is to use a secret token in the URL itself or as a header that only you and the Twenty system know, to validate the call. For example, when setting the webhook URL in settings, you might include a query param like `?token=YOUR_SECRET`. Your endpoint can then check that token on each request.
* **HTTPS:** Make sure your webhook URL is using HTTPS. This ensures the data in transit is encrypted. The Twenty webhook sender will require a secure endpoint for production.
* **Respond Quickly:** As mentioned, respond with a 200 OK as fast as possible. If you have complex processing to do, consider queuing the work in your system after acknowledging the webhook, so that the HTTP response is not delayed. This prevents timeouts on Twenty’s side.
* **Logging:** It’s a good idea to log received webhook events on your server (at least during development), so you can audit or debug if you think you missed an event. This can help verify that your endpoint is receiving calls as expected.
